-- check if windows button is pressed
-- load yaml on start in tb settings

--------
sometimes, the generate taskbar info fails.
So either: build in a automatic retry if there is a none in it, or create one at the start until it works and use it.
The problem then is, what happens if it could change dynamically?
for now, and generally for safety reasons, skip loop if it contains none and generate a tb on each iteration.
this will be useful later for adding dynamic borders.
